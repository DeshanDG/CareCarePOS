🚗 CareCare — Vehicle Repair & Maintenance Management System  

📌 Project Overview  
CareCare is a desktop application developed using **Java (OOP), JavaFX, and MySQL** to automate the daily operations of a vehicle repair and maintenance company.  
The system replaces manual Excel sheets and email-based processes with a structured, efficient, and user-friendly solution.  
  

CareCare, a startup vehicle repair and maintenance company, was managing its entire business using Excel sheets and emails. This approach was inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale as the business grew.  

Our goal was to design and implement a desktop software solution that:  
- Automates customer order handling.  
- Manages suppliers, employees, and inventory.  
- Generates monthly sales reports.  
- Sends email notifications to customers and employees.  
- Uses **OOP principles** for clean, maintainable code.  
 
- Designed the application using Object-Oriented Programming concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction).  
- Built the GUI with JavaFX for a modern and user-friendly experience.  
- Integrated MySQL for secure and reliable data storage.  
- Implemented JavaMail API to send email notifications:  
  - Customers are notified when their vehicles are ready.  
  - Employees are notified when new jobs are assigned.  
- Added reporting features for monthly sales tracking.  


- Reduced manual workload and errors by automating key processes.  
- Improved communication between the company, employees, and customers.  
- Enhanced decision-making with accurate and timely reports.  
- Delivered a scalable solution that can grow with the company.
